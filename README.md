# Chess Engine

Chess engine made in JS (P5). Already had the basic game made already and decided to add an engine to it. I originally got it inspired by [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk&t=878s) and another one by [Code Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g9SlVdv1PY). The Engine computes all available moves and uses certain shortcuts to cut corners.
